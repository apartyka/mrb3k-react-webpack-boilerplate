# React SAP Boiler Plate
This is a starting point for my React Single Page Applications.  Many thanks to the book SurviveJS - Webpack and React by Juho Vepsäläinen.

## Getting Started
- make your own blank repo on github.  Do not add Readme, .gitignore or liscence files to avoid conflicts
- clone this repository to your local machine
- cd to that directory in a terminal
- use git to remove my repository as the remote destination https://help.github.com/articles/removing-a-remote/
- use git to add your repo as the new remote https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/
- git add .
- git commit -m "boiler plate initialized"
- git push origin master

Take it from there.
